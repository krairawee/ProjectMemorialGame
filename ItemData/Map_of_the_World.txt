The Virtual World is surrounded by walls on all four sides, and there is a loading point between the two areas of the map. The loading point splits the map into two sidesâ€”the mansion side and the chapel side. When going through the map loading point, sight and hearing are momentarily cut off. In order to go between the mansion and chapel, it is necessary to go through the map loading point and across the river that runs parallel to it.
