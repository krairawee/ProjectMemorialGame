The killing game simulator's text file contained the following information: Objects can't break. Avatars cannot be injured. However, the body's five senses are connected to the avatar, and any damage an avatar takes is felt by the user's real body. If an avatar takes fatal damage, then the real body will also die from shock. Besides that, the Virtual World is the same as the real world, down to the laws of physics. There are no special travel methods such as vehicles or warps.
